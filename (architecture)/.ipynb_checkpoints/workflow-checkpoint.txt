Define the Problem
-----------------------------

A grayscale photograph (single-channel Luminance).

A style reference image (full-color artwork).
And produces:

A colorized version of the photo that also exhibits the chosen artistic style.



Key capabilities:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colorization: Predict plausible color channels (e.g., a* and b* in Lab space) from luminance alone.

Style Transfer: Impose the color and texture “signature” of a chosen artwork onto the newly colorized image.

Style selection: Expose a finite set of styles; allow the user to pick one at inference time.

User interface: Provide a GUI for uploading a photo, selecting a style, and viewing/download the result.

Grayscale
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input Stage
-----------
File Upload

User selects and uploads a single‐channel (grayscale) image.

Validation & Preview

System verifies file type/size.

Displays the uploaded grayscale preview.



Style Selection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Configuration Stage (“Middle Stage”)
------------------------------------------
Preset Selection

User chooses one of a few colorization presets (e.g., Natural, Vibrant, Vintage, High-Key).

Optional Boosters

User toggles scene-specific hints (e.g., Sky Enhancer, Greenery Boost, Skin Tone Stabilizer).

Confidence Threshold

User adjusts a slider (0–100%) that sets how conservatively the model applies color (lower = more color; higher = more grayscale retention).

“Colorize” Action

Clicking the Colorize button bundles:

The L-channel image data,

The chosen preset ID and booster flags,

The confidence threshold value,
and sends them to the model.

2. Processing Stage (Back-End Model)
----------------------------------------
Pre-processing

Normalize and resize L-channel to model’s input dimensions.

Feature Encoding

A convolutional encoder extracts structural features from the grayscale input.

Conditioning

Inject preset embedding, booster flags, and threshold into the model’s bottleneck.

Decoding

Decoder predicts the a* and b* chrominance channels.

Confidence Gating

Compute per-pixel confidence; zero-out colors below the threshold to preserve grayscale.

Reconstruction

Merge L + predicted ab channels, convert from Lab to RGB, apply gamma correction.

------------------------------

3. Details
-----------
A gallery (thumbnails) of your predetermined art styles is displayed.

The user clicks on one thumbnail to pick “Style A,” “Style B,” etc.

(Optional) Parameter Adjustment

If you expose tunable weights, the user may see sliders for:
– Style Strength (how boldly the artwork’s colors/textures are applied)
– Color Saturation (overall vibrancy of the output)
– Smoothness or Detail (trade-off between sharp brush-stroke appearance vs. cleaner fill)

The user drags these sliders to fine-tune the look.

Preview / “Apply” Action

A “Preview” or “Colorize” button appears once a style (and any sliders) are set.

By clicking it, the user submits the grayscale image + style choice (+ any slider values) to the model.

At that moment, your back-end model:

Encodes the L-channel of the grayscale photo.

Encodes the chosen style reference (or style embedding).

Fuses them and decodes into color channels.

Once processing completes, the GUI replaces the input preview (or opens a new pane) with the final RGB output image, ready for download.

In short, the “middle stage” is style & settings selection, plus clicking “Colorize”—this is where the user gives the system the extra input it needs (which style, how strongly) before the model runs.



Output Stage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Display & Download

GUI replaces the grayscale preview with the colorized image.

“Download” button appears for the user to save the result.

Optional Real-Time Preview

In high-performance setups, small thumbnails update on slider changes before full run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By organizing your interface and pipeline into these four stages, you give users a clear, guided path from uploading a simple grayscale photo to obtaining a styled, colorized image.

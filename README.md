# colorization_task1

## Artistic Style Transfer in Colorization: 

In this task, I will create a model that colorizes grayscale photos while simultaneously applying a specific artistic style to the colorized output. 

- This exercise examines my ability to mix image colorization and style transfer approaches.
- The model should let users select from predetermined artistic styles.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) is required to allow users to submit photographs and choose styles.
